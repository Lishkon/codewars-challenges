# Java learning path

This is the repository dedicated to Java learning. I am going to keep track of my progress here using variety of options, including books/courses listing and so on.

Actually, the only and one reason for me doing this is organizing my learning routine as well as keeping everything in a single place that can possibly be shared with anyone else.

If you are passionate about learning any programming language, and need a tool to organize things up, I would be more than glad to know that my example helped and inspired you.

# Theory
There are items I need to learn better and some are already learnt:
- [ ] OOP Principles
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Access identifiers
- [ ] Stream API
- [ ] Data types
- [ ] Collections
- [ ] Exception handling
- [ ] I/O
- [ ] Basic understanding of threading and concurrency
- [ ] Basic design patterns like singleton, factory, etc.
- [ ] ...

### List of websites which I use to find the tasks:
1. [Codewars](https://codewars.com)
2. [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com)
3. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
4. [Codesignal (ex-CodeFights)](https://app.codesignal.com)
5. [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com)
6. ...

### My rules:
1. It is better to do it less hard but regularly
2. Read each day
3. TBD

# Practice
Here goes a list of tasks solved for some particular amount of time. I started logging them from April 2018, but there are a lot of untracked tasks and katas (referring to Codewars) which I solved a long ago before that.
